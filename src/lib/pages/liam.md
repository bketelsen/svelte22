This starter includes an `Callout.svelte` component. It's not particularly useful on its own, but here's how you might use it inside of a Markdown post, thanks to mdsvex.

You can inject any Svelte components you want into Markdown! Just import them in a `<script>` tag and then use them wherever you like.

For that matter, you can inject any HTML anywhere! (Note that you cannot use Markdown _inside_ Svelte components or HTML, however. Any opened tag must be closed before returning to Markdown.)
